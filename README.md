Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @n8tlarsen, an embedded firmware professional with experience in C/C++ and VHDL.
Iâ€™m interested in efficient and maintainable software that plays nice with hardware.
A custom keyboard project got me learning KiCad, Rust and Vim as well as taking up Linux as my daily driver.
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on embedded Rust projects.
